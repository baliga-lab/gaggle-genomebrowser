<p>Domain model for the genome browser. The core abstractions of the genome
browser are Dataset, Sequence, Track, and Feature. A Dataset consists of a set of
Sequences, and a set of Tracks. Tracks aggregate Features with coordinates on 
those Sequences.</p>

<p>A Feature is essentially some data related to a position on
a sequence. A Feature is a tuple containing of location and some other data.
(sequenceId, strand, start, end, ...). Maybe location should be a separate
artifact? Main subtypes of Feature are Feature.Quantitative that has a floating
point measurement and Feature.Named that has a label. Feature.Nested is
composed of internal Features (for example introns and exons).</p>

<p>FeatureFilter allows a collection of features to be
filtered by sequence and position on the sequence (for example to find features
in the visible window on the screen).</p>

<p>The Dataset abstracts the source of data allowing the application to retrieve
desired tracks and features.</p>

<p>The goal is that model package should have no external dependencies (except
jfc libraries and utils).</p>
