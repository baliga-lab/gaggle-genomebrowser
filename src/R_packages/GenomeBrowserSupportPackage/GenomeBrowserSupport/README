 GenomeBrowserSupport
======================

The GenomeBrowserSupport package enables data exchange between R and the Gaggle
Genome Browser. Various R data structures can be converted into data.frames
with the proper structure to become tracks in a genome browser data set. That
structure depends on the exact type of track we're creating, but generally
relates some data to coordinates on the genome (sequence, strand, start, end)
or (sequence, strand, position).

MeDiChI
-------
This package has one unlisted dependency, the MeDiChI library. It is needed only
for certain functions and may be ignored if those functions are not used. These
functions are:
  * medichiProfile.chip.deconv
  * medichiProfile.deconv.entire.genome
  * medichiProfileAsGaggleMatrix
  
Many of the other MeDiChI related functions take the fit data structure produced
by MeDiChI as input, but do not directly depend on MeDiChI.

Instructions for installing MeDiChI can be found here:
