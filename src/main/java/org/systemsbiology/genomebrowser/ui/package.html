<p>Swing based user-interface components for the Genome Browser. UI serves as a facade to the UI package. MainWindow is the main window. GenomeViewPanel is where the tracks are drawn.</p>

<p>External callers should only access the ui package through ExternalUiController. The classes in this package attempt to use the swing
event thread correctly. No classes in this package should be called on any
other thread except ExternalUiController, which respondes to all calls by delegating to SwingUtilities.invokeLater(...).</p>
