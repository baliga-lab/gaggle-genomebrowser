<body>

<p>The <b>app</b> package is intended to be a place for application scope,
global configuration, and framework-like components.</p>

<p>The idea partially implemented here was to combine dependency injection
and a component/plug-in architecture. Loosely coupled components would
communicate with the core features through an internal API and with each
other by open extensible events.</p>

<p>Be warned that the implementation is highly incomplete and not fully thought
through.</p>
