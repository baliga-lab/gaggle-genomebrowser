<p>The dataset file is a text file in a format similar to JSON. This package contains
a parser for that format.</p>

<p>The dataset file format is intended to be more human-readable and editable than
XML, although it's highly arguable that writing my own parser wasn't wise. It's possible
that I will switch to JSON in the future.</p>
